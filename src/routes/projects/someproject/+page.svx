## Project Overview

**"Surreal Dreamscape"** is a personal 3D art and animation project exploring abstract environments inspired by dreams and subconscious states. The goal was to evoke emotion through atmosphere, lighting, and motion.

## Concept & Inspiration

The concept stems from lucid dreaming experiences and the blurred boundary between memory and imagination. I wanted to create a visual narrative that feels otherworldly yet emotionally grounded.

## Tools & Techniques

- **3D Modeling & Animation:** Blender
- **Texturing:** Substance Painter
- **Compositing:** After Effects
- **Color Grading:** DaVinci Resolve
- **Sound Design:** Audacity + field recordings

## Role

This was a solo project ‚Äî I was responsible for the full pipeline:
- Concept development
- Modeling, texturing, rigging
- Lighting & animation
- Post-production & sound

## Process Highlights

- Hand-sculpted terrain using Blender‚Äôs dynamic topology tools
- Procedural textures for fluid-like surfaces
- Used volumetric lighting and motion blur to enhance dreamlike mood
- Composited final passes with custom LUTs for color tone
